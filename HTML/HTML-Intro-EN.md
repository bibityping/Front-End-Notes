# HTML Intro

[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆæœ¬](HTML-Intro.md)

HTML is an abbreviation for Hypertext Markup Language. It is not a programming language, but a markup language used to structure the content of web pages.

HTML is like building a house with only a structure.

## HTML Elements

ðŸ“Ž HTML documents are made up of many elements.

ðŸ“Ž The content of the HTML element is written in the Opening tag and the Closing tag.

Take the `<p>`element as an example,the `<p>` tag is the Opening tagï¼Œthe `</p>` tag is the Closing tag,the content of the element "I am a Front-end Engineer"is written between these two tags.

```html
<p>I am a Front-end Engineer</p>
```

Attributes can be added within the opening tag of an element, and the attributes provide additional information to the HTML that is not displayed in the page.

Take the anchor tag `<a>` as an exampleï¼Œadd the `href` attribute to the opening tagï¼Œwhich will jump to the specified page when the user clicks on it.

```html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a"
  >The Anchor element</a
>
```
