# Front-End-Notes

[中文版本](README.md)

I picked out some must-know, and some technically difficult content from the front-end learning notes I recorded in the past, and reorganized them in this repository.

The purpose is to regularly review what I have learned, and updates have been outdated knowledge.

I also hope that the notes I share can help newcomers to learn front-end knowledge.Let's make progress together💪.
